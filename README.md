# Castle_Runner
GameMaker (GML) racing/platformer game

Small game built in GameMaker Studio 2 based on the prompt: Racing game - Sci-Fi - in a Miyazaki inspired world

In this game you race against a castle defense laser while trying to disarm a world ending weapon hidden deep inside the castle walls.
Across three short levels, you:
-Fly in by plane as enemy aircraft swarm the skies.
-Find a magic crystal necklace that lets you leap up the castle’s outer walls.
-Navigate the pitch black interior, dodging defense robots to reach the core and shut down the weapon before it fires.
